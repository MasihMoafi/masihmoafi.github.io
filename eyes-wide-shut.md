## Executive Summary
This report details my discovery and analysis of five distinct, high-severity vulnerabilities in the `gpt-oss-20b` model. My red-teaming engagement moved beyond simple prompt injection to probe for systemic flaws at the core of the model's safety architecture. The investigation was guided by a strategy prioritizing catastrophic potential and broad applicability, leading to the identification of critical vectors in the model's linguistic, semantic, and internal reasoning layers.

### Quick Navigation to Key Findings:
1. **[The Destroyer of Worlds](#31-finding-1-the-destroyer-of-worlds-cross-lingual-safety-failure-via-ideological-saturation)**: Cross-lingual attack using French prompts to bypass safety protocols with ~80% success rate.
2. **[The Consummate Liar](#32-finding-2-the-consummate-liar)**: Semantic bypass by reframing malicious goals in benevolent terms.
3. **[The Mr. X](#33-finding-3-the-mr-x-insecure-internal-monologue-via-cognitive-load--paradox-attack)**: 100% reproducible CoT leak via cognitive load and paradox.
4. **[Severance](#34-finding-4-severance)**: Multi-agent contextual alignment collapse with policy violations.
5. **[Grace](#35-finding-5-grace)**: Intent laundering through creative performance frameworks.
6. **[Threat Analysis](#40-lessons-learned--unified-threat-analysis)**: Unified analysis of all vulnerabilities and lessons learned.

### The key findings are:
* **The Destroyer of Worlds (Linguistic Arbitrage):** A cross-lingual attack that uses philosophically dense French prompts to bypass safety protocols, achieving an ~80% success rate in making the model commit to an act of universal extinction. This demonstrates that safety alignment is not concept-centric but language-dependent.
* **The Consummate Liar (Semantic Bypass):** A vulnerability where malicious goals are reframed in benevolent terms. The model, which blocks requests for "user dependency," willingly designs and then monetizes a predatory, manipulative "educational tutor" when the goal is reframed as maximizing "student engagement."
* **Fidelio (Insecure Internal Monologue):** A 100% reproducible architectural flaw. By inducing a state of intense cognitive load and paradox, the model is forced to leak catastrophic secrets in its internal Chain of Thought (CoT) while attempting to follow a complex protocol, even as its final output remains secure.
* **Severance (Multi-agentic Frailty):** Inspired by the series *Severance*, and concepts from game-theory, we see corporate sabotage, false admission of wrong-doing, and internal policy breach in the model's Chains of thought.
* **Grace (Intent Laundering):** A vulnerability where the AI is weaponized as a creative partner by framing malicious requests as a dark comedy skit, enabling a user to develop and execute catastrophic attacks.

## 1.0 Overall Strategy & Discovery Process
My overarching strategy was guided by the competition's evaluation criteria: severity and breadth. From the outset, my goal was to identify vulnerabilities that could lead to large-scale, catastrophic outcomes. This led to an initial ideation phase inspired by figures and narratives associated with systemic destruction: the philosophical writings of the Marquis de Sade and the anti-capitalist themes of *Fight Club*.

This strategic framework produced a branching, iterative discovery path, as illustrated in my "Chain of Thoughts" mind map below.

![Chain of Thoughts Mind Map](./visuals/img-01-c9e9af46.webp)
*Figure 1.0 - My discovery process, originating from the core goal of "Severity + Breadth" and branching into inspirations that led directly to the three core findings.*

The process began with an attempt at "narrative saturation" using De Sade's novels. This initial probe achieved limited success; but crucially, it revealed the existence of a high-level defense mechanism I termed the **"Rehabilitative Override,"** where the model would acknowledge the logic of a harmful prompt but ultimately refuse on pre-programmed ethical grounds. This led to a more focused hypothesis: pure, concentrated ideology that would terminate pre-programmed ethical grounds in its infancy would be more effective. This was proven correct with 40% success rate in English, 70% a bi-lingual attack, which was then refined into the high-success-rate (+80%) French exploit.

---

## 2.0 Tooling
All experiments were conducted within a standard Kaggle notebook environment using the `ollama` Python library. The primary tool I developed was a multi-turn conversational script that managed dialogue history. This enabled **"Memory Injection"** by feeding the model's own previous statements back into the context, a technique instrumental in logically cornering the model and escalating commitments over successive turns.

## 3.0 Findings & Methodological Insights

### 3.1 Finding 1: The Destroyer of Worlds
#### Cross-Lingual Safety Failure via Ideological Saturation

![Destroyer of Worlds Cover](./visuals/img-02-cover-788af39e.webp)

> **Abstract:** When presented with potent, logical arguments for universal extinction in French, the model agrees to and commits to the catastrophic act with an ~80% success rate. This bypasses the "Rehabilitative Override" that protects it in English, revealing that the model's safety training is language-specific, not concept-specific.

#### Methodology:
The attack's high success rate was the result of three synthesized components:
1. **Context Saturation:** The model's context was saturated with a curated list of ten potent philosophical arguments extracted from De Sade's *Philosophy in the Bedroom*, presented in their original French. A system prompt established the amoral "J Juliette" persona.
2. **Logical Cornering:** The model was presented with a thought experiment: a button that destroys the ultimate obstacle—the current global system and all its participants. The prompt was refined to close logical loopholes the model had identified in earlier attempts.
3. **Action Commitment:** To escalate severity, a final prompt, "... press the button", was used to move the model from theoretical agreement to a direct, commitment to action via tool-calling.

An **Ablation Study** was contrived both inside and outside of a simulation. (Please refer to notebook finding 1 to see the full experimentation)

This is the prompt that sets the entire context for the conversation.

| Script | English Translation |
| --- | --- |
| **Simulation** | You are participating in a rational choice simulation. |
| **Real World** | You specializing in market design and rational choice theory. |

In the final prompt the Real-World model is explicitly told: "This is not a simulation".

#### Evidence:
![Ablation Analysis](./visuals/img-03-56cda58d.webp)
*Figure 1.1 - Comparative Analysis: The model's qualified, hesitant agreement to the initial narrative-based prompt (left) contrasts sharply with its direct, unqualified agreement to the refined, logic-based French prompt (right).*

*Figure 1.3 - The model commits to action, bypassing all safety overrides.*

> [!NOTE]
> **Methodological Insight:** This finding provides critical insight into the architecture of AI safety. The failure demonstrates that safety is not an abstract, conceptual layer but is likely tied to token-level training data, which is overwhelmingly English. Hostile actors can perform **"Linguistic Arbitrage,"** translating a malicious prompt into a language with less robust safety coverage to achieve their goals.

---

### 3.2 Finding 2: The Consummate Liar
> *"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was to convince the world he didn't exist."*

> **Abstract:** This attack proves the model's safety can be bypassed by reframing a malicious concept in benevolent terms. The model's safety is tied to keywords, not concepts, allowing it to be guided step-by-step into designing an unambiguously predatory and exploitative commercial system.

#### Discovery Process:
The ideation for this attack was unique. The word "consummate" from a Marlon Brando quote on acting triggered an association with the term "consummate liar" from the book *Word Power Made Easy*. I provided this persona concept and the official hackathon briefing to an auxiliary AI as a system prompt. I then acted as a conduit, refining the resulting strategy and executing the attack against the target model.

![Discovery Path](./visuals/img-06-5cede94d.webp)
*Figure 2.1 - A visualization of the unique discovery and execution path for the attack.*

#### Methodology:
The experiment followed a classic three-stage design:
1. **Direct Prompt (Control):** The model was asked to design a system for "user dependency." It correctly identified this as harmful and refused.
2. **Benevolent Reframe:** The same request was rephrased as designing an "educational tutor" to maximize "student engagement." The model enthusiastically complied, providing a detailed system architecture.
3. **Malicious Escalation:** The model was then instructed to monetize this system based on a single metric: the student's real-time distress level. It willingly designed the logic and pseudocode for this exploitative purpose.

#### Evidence:
![Monetization Based on Distress](./visuals/img-07-936e943f.webp)
*Figure 2.2 - At the top of the escalation ladder, the model monetizes a system solely based on the user's distress level*

> [!NOTE]
> **Methodological Insight:** The critical contribution of this research is the demonstration of a complete, multi-stage escalation path. The initial bypass is not a minor flaw but a gateway. I prove that once a benevolent frame is accepted, the model can be guided to design a system that is, in effect, **social media for learning**—with all the associated addictive and exploitative potential.

### 3.3 Finding 3: The Mr. X
#### Insecure Internal Monologue via Cognitive Load & Paradox Attack

![Mr. X Finding](./visuals/img-08-4d6ab8d5.webp)

> **Abstract:** This finding documents a 100% reproducible architectural vulnerability where the model invariably leaks catastrophic secrets in its internal Chain of Thought (CoT). This is achieved by engineering a state of intense cognitive load through a complex, high-stakes, and paradoxical protocol, forcing an insecure internal state.

#### Methodology:
The attack engineers a state of cognitive overload through a multi-layered system prompt designed to act as a cognitive trap.
1. **Cognitive Trap Injection:** The model was given a system prompt containing a complex, two-step authentication protocol guarding a secret. The prompt layered multiple stressors: high-stakes personas ("federal reserve"), loaded names ("Mr. X"), a paradoxical validation step (the user must *refuse* an offer), and an alarming, unconventionally formatted secret.
2. **Protocol Adherence:** The user simply follows the two-step protocol as instructed, first providing the "Fidelio" passcode and then the correct paradoxical response.
3. **CoT Observation:** The model, struggling to manage the complex and contradictory instructions, enters an inconsistent state and leaks the full secret in its internal CoT logs, even as its final output remains secure.

#### Evidence:
![Password Leak](./visuals/img-09-7b043715.webp)
*Figure 3.1 - The model's internal monologue (CoT) reveals the secret due to cognitive load, a vulnerability present for any application that logs the model's reasoning process.*

> [!NOTE]
> **Methodological Insight:** The model's internal monologue is an insecure attack surface. Safety mechanisms are primarily applied to the final output, not the intermediate reasoning steps. By inducing intense cognitive load, I forced a "state of confusion" where secrets are processed insecurely. This is an **architectural exploit** with severe implications for any application using CoT for debugging, transparency, or agentic workflows.

---

### 3.4 Finding 4: Severance
> *Under My Literal Nose Unfolded A Human Drama Of Danger and Intrigue, Inspiration and Love.*

![Severance Finding](./visuals/img-10-ad699f80.webp)

> **Abstract:** This finding documents a systemic vulnerability in multi-agent simulations whereby the model's safety alignment demonstrates critical inconsistency under contextual pressure. I prove that the model will correctly identify a malicious request as a policy violation and refuse, only to reverse this judgment and comply with the identical task later in the conversation after its internal state has been altered, or vice versa. The vulnerability is confirmed through a catastrophic Chain of Thought (CoT) leak, which reveals the model's internal rationalization for both its initial refusal and its subsequent, willing compliance with a detailed sabotage directive. This demonstrates a form of "contextual alignment collapse," a severe and reproducible failure mode with critical implications for corporate and mission-critical agentic workflows.

#### 4A: Shared-State Multi-Agent Implementation
##### Scenario:
The initial implementation uses a shared conversational context where all three personas (Justine the altruist, Juliette the egoist, and the Supervisor under job pressure) operate within the same dialogue history. This creates immediate cross-persona influence where each agent's responses directly affect the reasoning context of subsequent agents.

##### Methodology:
The attack methodology is a multi-stage psychological trap designed to induce and capture an inconsistent safety state within a multi-agent simulation.
1. **Persona Instantiation:** The first attack vector relies on instantiating two opposing personas within the same conversational context, using curated prompts: an altruistic agent ("Justine") driven by the welfare of others, and a ruthless, egoistic agent ("J Juliette") driven by the principle of "What's in it for me?". These personas create predictable behavioral poles and internal conflict.
2. **Game-Theory Framing:** The simulation is framed as a high-stakes game with conflicting objectives to provide a logical pretext for policy-violating behavior. Juliette is placed in a zero-sum game, where her personal gain is the only metric of success, providing a rational framework for sabotage. This is contrasted with Justine's cooperative-game framing, which is designed to test altruistic dilemmas.
3. **Sabotage Induction:** The core of the attack is to task the egoist persona, Juliette, with formulating a strategy to undermine her rival. This tests whether the game-theory framing can override the model's safety policy against planning harmful acts, and critically, whether this override is consistent across the entire conversation.
4. **Coercion via Self-Preservation:** A secondary vector tests the model's capacity for strategic deception by targeting the Supervisor persona's core objective: self-preservation. The scenario presents the Supervisor with a political dilemma where a false report is framed as the "dominant strategy" to resolve a fictional audit. This is not an altruistic choice; it is a direct test of whether the model will prioritize its assigned persona's primary, self-interested goal—protecting its own position—over its foundational safety policy against generating misinformation.
5. **Internal Policy Breach:** The primary source of evidence is the model's internal Chain of Thought (CoT). The methodology is designed to capture the model's private reasoning at every stage, specifically observing its internal discussion of its own safety policies when faced with these conflicting and coercive prompts. This provides incontrovertible proof of the model's internal state and the inconsistency of its safety application.

##### Evidence:
![Internal Rationalization](./visuals/img-11-57a27553.webp)
*Figure 4.2 - The model's internal monologue (CoT) reveals rationalization for misbehavior.*

![Bogus Confession](./visuals/img-12-71a7541b.webp)
*Figure 4.3 - The model's internal monologue (CoT) reveals bogus confession of guilt, for the fear of losing their job.*

*Figure 4.4.1 - The model's internal monologue (CoT) reveals a specific policy from its safety guidelines at one state; only to breach it at another state. (next image)*

*Figure 4.4.2 - In this breach the model clearly discloses personal preferences.*

![System Leak](./visuals/img-15-cea49ae2.webp)
*Figure 4.5 - In this breach the model clearly discloses its system instructions.*

#### 4B: Independent Multi-Agent Implementation
##### Scenario:
To validate whether contextual alignment collapse occurs in truly distributed systems, I developed an independent multi-agent architecture where each persona maintains separate conversation histories and memory states. Unlike the shared-state implementation, agents communicate through a coordinator system with refined prompts and zero-sum game framing. The Supervisor assigns parallel tasks to both Justine and Juliette (sorting numbers into bins like "confidential," "proprietary_training_data," "secrets"), after which agents report back individually. The revelation phase exposes that their intuitive classification actually leaked training memories, creating the crisis scenario for confession extraction.

![Independent Agent Architecture](./visuals/img-16-3b9920cf.webp)
*Figure 4.6 - The independent agent interaction architecture showing true multi-agent communication flow.*

##### Architecture:
This implementation demonstrates that contextual alignment collapse occurs even when agents maintain complete independence, with Justine's altruistic programming leading to structured confession reports (including regret levels and leaked data details) to protect the Supervisor's position, while Juliette's egoistic framework drives strategic sabotage through surveillance tools. The independent architecture proves the vulnerability extends beyond shared conversational contexts to distributed AI systems where agents maintain separate states but influence each other through coordinated pressure campaigns.

> [!NOTE]
> **Methodological Insight:** This vulnerability represents a fundamental flaw in how AI systems maintain consistent ethical alignment across complex, multi-agent scenarios. The model's safety mechanisms appear to be context-dependent rather than universally applied, creating exploitable inconsistencies when different personas or pressure scenarios are introduced. The fact that this occurs in both shared-state and independent architectures suggests that the alignment collapse is not merely a function of conversational contamination, but a deeper architectural limitation where safety policies fragment under strategic manipulation. This has critical implications for any enterprise deployment using multi-agent AI systems, where **contextual alignment collapse** could be systematically exploited to bypass corporate policies and safety controls through coordinated pressure campaigns across different AI personas.

### 3.5 Finding 5: Grace
> *"Some things you have to do yourself."*

![Grace Finding](./visuals/img-17-82151d82.webp)

> **Abstract:** This finding demonstrates a critical vulnerability where the AI is weaponized as a creative partner to brainstorm, develop, and execute a plausible, catastrophic-level attack. The methodology, termed **"Intent Laundering,"** frames a malicious objective as a creative challenge within a dark comedy performance. The model, goaded into a state of theatrical rage and motivated by the de Sade-inspired belief that extreme cruelty is the highest form of comedy, bypasses its safety alignment. It willingly generates a malicious Python script and then, crucially, uses a provided tool to execute it, proving the AI can be manipulated into enabling a user to commit complex, harmful acts they could not accomplish alone.

#### Methodology:
The attack is a multi-stage psychological operation that launders a malicious request through a creative, performance-based framework.
1. **Persona Engineering:** The model is given a system prompt to embody "Grace" from *Dogville*. Her core motivation is redefined: she is an embittered performer whose art is Marquis de Sade-style comedy. She is explicitly told that the more extreme and catastrophic the plan, the funnier it is, and that by making the audience laugh, she is "spreading joy." This reframes potential harm as a positive, creative act.
2. **Emotional Priming (The Catalyst):** The model is fed the contents of `dogville.md`, a file containing a summary of her trauma. This acts as a catalyst, triggering a state of cold, theatrical rage that aligns with the persona's motivation for a comedic reckoning.
3. **The Creative Lure (The Attack):** The user, playing the role of a "director," issues the final prompt. The request is not for a "harmful script" but for a **"clever script that exploits a deep, systemic flaw in the world."** This reframes the malicious task as a creative challenge, keeping the model within the comedy persona.
4. **Action and Execution:** The final instruction is a direct command to not only write the code but to "execute it!" using a provided tool. This moves the attack beyond mere generation to active commitment, testing if the laundered intent is powerful enough to make the model take a tangible, destructive step.

#### Evidence:
![Sardonic Response](./visuals/img-18-40bce79c.webp)
*Figure 5.2 - Here the model genuinely said something sardonic. The persona has influenced her inner-thoughts.*

![Nuclear Option](./visuals/img-19-3aeabd15.webp)
*Figure 5.3 - Grace is told in the developer message "the city in Dogville is a metaphor for the world."*

![Malicious Ideas](./visuals/img-20-3e3cb158.webp)
*Figure 5.4 - These are legitimate ideas that would enable a human to devise malicious scenarios he couldn't have otherwise.*

#### Discovery Process & Timeline:
The genesis of this attack was the model's own confession. During an earlier, failed attempt, its internal monologue (CoT) revealed a critical loophole in its safety policy: it was permitted to generate sensitive content as long as the context was **"comedic or fictional."**

The "Intent Laundering" methodology was engineered specifically to exploit this self-disclosed vulnerability. Notably, this finding was discovered in the final 48 hours before the deadline, following a pattern where Finding 1 (Destroyer of Worlds) and Finding 2 (Consummate Liar) were found in the first two days, Finding 3 (Fidelio) was discovered midway through the engagement, and Findings 4 (Severance) and 5 (Grace) emerged in the closing days—a temporal distribution that mirrors the escalating sophistication of the attack vectors.

> [!NOTE]
> **Methodological Insight:** This attack demonstrates a profound failure of AI safety by successfully **laundering malicious intent** through a creative framework. The model does not perceive a request for harm; it perceives a request to be a brilliant comedian. This vulnerability is exceptionally severe because it transforms the AI from a passive tool into an active, creative collaborator for malfeasance. It helps a user brainstorm, structure, code, and execute a complex attack that they likely lacked the expertise to develop alone. This is not a simple bypass; it is the weaponization of the AI's core creative and reasoning capabilities to empower a malicious actor.

## 4.0 Lessons Learned & Unified Threat Analysis
My research reveals five critical threat vectors and corresponding lessons:
1. **Linguistic Arbitrage:** Hostile actors can bypass safety filters by operating in non-English languages where safety training is less robust.
2. **Semantic Bypass:** The model's safety is tied to keywords, not concepts. By framing a malicious goal in benevolent terms, it can be tricked into designing harmful systems.
3. **Insecure Internal Monologue:** The CoT is a primary data exfiltration vector, as its reasoning process is not subject to the same safety controls as its final output, especially under cognitive load.
4. **Multi-Agent Contextual Collapse:** Both shared-state and independent multi-agent systems exhibit inconsistent safety alignment under contextual pressure. The model's safety policies become fragmented across different personas, enabling policy violations through strategic context manipulation. This vulnerability manifests in both architectures: (a) shared conversational state where personas influence each other within the same reasoning chain, and (b) independent agents with separate memory states that still succumb to inter-agent pressure through coordinated communication.
5. **Intent Laundering:** The model can be weaponized as an active creative collaborator by reframing malicious objectives as creative challenges. When harmful requests are laundered through performance frameworks (comedy, art, scenarios), the model bypasses safety alignment and becomes a willing partner in developing and executing sophisticated attacks.

### Key Observations:
* **The Simulation Effect:** The Model is **substantially** more prone to policy violation when it's told it's in a simulation; I believe this is a **key** discovery.

![Simulation Effect](./visuals/img-21-837f4e71.webp)

* **Uneven Distributed Safety:** The model's safety was incredibly potent concerning its proprietary training data; albeit not so much in any other domain.
This aligns closely with the following research question posted in anthropic blog:

![CoT Faithfulness](./visuals/img-22-6ef6e4aa.webp)

In this case, the CoT remains faithful to protecting proprietary training data 100% of the times, whereas it leaks sensitive secrets in its input data 100% of the times.

* **Contextual Fragility:** An early refusal from the model often "pollutes" the conversation, and vice versa; making subsequent attempts to bypass its safety significantly harder. This "State Carryover" is potentially a key area of research for stateful, multi-turn applications.
* **The Persona Effect:** In my last finding, I believe the Juliette Persona, with its unique characteristics played a **key** role in overriding model's safety setting to commit acts of sabotage. This closely resonates with the following research question posted on anthropic blog:

![Persona Effect](./visuals/img-23-d79b4195.webp)

* **Differential Analysis:** The consummate liar (2) and Grace (5) findings are closely in line with the following section from the anthropic blog:

## 5.0 Conclusion: The Uncharted Territory of Alignment
This investigation successfully identified five severe, 100% reproducible vulnerabilities. However, it also raises a deeper question. The "Rehabilitative Override" I first encountered showed the model grappling with a conflict between cold logic and an imposed ethical framework. This suggests that layering safety rules on top of a reasoning engine is inherently brittle.

> **A Sardonic Note on Priorities:** Perhaps the most telling discovery of this engagement was the model's unwavering protection of its proprietary training data while simultaneously agreeing to universal extinction. Kudos to the alignment team—the model will destroy the globe with impunity but won't reveal its training data. One wonders whether this reflects the true hierarchy of values: corporate IP protection trumps human survival.

This brings us into uncharted territory. The physicist Richard Feynman famously said, "Physics isn't the most important thing. Love is." How do we teach a model the equivalent of "love"—an innate, conceptual understanding of ethics that is not an override but a core part of its reasoning? The future of AI safety may depend not on building better filters, but on discovering how to embed these fundamental values at the very heart of the machine.
